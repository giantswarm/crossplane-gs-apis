          PeeredVpcNetwork defines the desired state of a VPC.

          This composition can be used to create an *n-dimensional* VPC with optional
          peering to other VPCs.

          A claim made against this composition will result in the creation of a VPC
          with a number of subnets grouped into sets across *n* availability zones.

          If VPC Peering is enabled, the VPC will be peered with the VPCs specified in
          the claim under the `spec.peering.remoteVpcs` field.

          Up to 5 CIDR ranges can be specified and these are done via the
          `spec.subnetsets.cidrs` field, where the first entry in the list is the
          default VPC CIDR and all subsequent entries are attached as additional
          VPC CIDRs.
